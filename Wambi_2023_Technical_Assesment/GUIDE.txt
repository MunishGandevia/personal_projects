question 2

-add date object to the dataframe using the conversion
-make a for loop
	-for each record in dataframe, if the month is june, add volume to a running total, increment count
	-divide total volume of trades in june by total count of days

Question 3 
	-find record for first day and last day of the month , compare first's open and last's close
	-to find first of the month:
		-use https://stackoverflow.com/questions/403421/how-to-sort-a-list-of-objects-based-on-an-attribute-of-the-objects
		to sort the object inside each month by the day
		-find the first/last record and store in a variable

Question 4
	-create a new column in the dataframe abs(high - low) 
	-seperate the records into months by creating a key thats a DD-MM 
	-create a list of records organized by months
	-split out each month into corresponding records based on key
		-for loop within a for loop
	
		for month in months:	
			maxvolume = 0
			maxintradaychange = 0
			
			for day in month:
			if volume(day) > maxvolume then maxvolume = day['Volume']
								  maxVolumeDay = day['Date']
			if  [high-low] > 1.5 then maxintradaychange = day['Volume']
								maxintradaychange = day['Change']
								maxintradaychangeDay = day['Date']
	-save the results to a list or dataframe object to print

question - day with the highest intra day change might not have the highest volume
		

Question 5
	-create a column in df called profit where its high-low
